Coding Exercise: **Bowling**

Rules of the exercise:
In this exercise, we ask that you write a program that calculates a bowling score for a completed game. You have full flexibility to define the inputs, outputs, and display for this program.

{Reasoning behind the exercise and followup steps were here}

**General Rules**

• Make it your own, you may use code snippets or references from the internet but please do not copy and paste. We are looking to understand your coding styles and knowledge, not Google’s.

• Focus on what matters. If you are applying for a frontend role, then impress us with your UI/UX skills. If this is more of a backend or full-stack position, then show off those skills (console applications work perfectly).

• There is no right or wrong way to complete the exercise.

• In case you don’t bowl, no problem we have you covered! Included below is a link to help you understand everything you need to know about a bowling game.

**Bill's notes** 
As far as these things go, I thought this is one of the more thought-out and well-reasoned at-home coding exercises associated with an interview process.  To be completely honest, I normally nope-out of these sorts of tasks on principle or at least try to drive interviews in another direction.   With this specific tasking,  I appreciated that this approach gives a candidate a home-field project from which to discuss and troubleshoot and test out collaboration styles during later interviews.   It also helps that bowling scoring has some interesting problems to solve.   

In the future as I teach myself other platforms and frameworks, I intend to use this as a sample project to explore new toolchains.  

**Self-imposed limitations aka, "The excuses"** :)

 - Spend no more than a couple of hours 
 - Do not use a quick-start project, unless it is built into the IDE 
 - Use an IDE that isn't your daily driver (to gain experience)
      - (I used VS Code on a mac instead of full VS on Windows) 
- Use a platform or framework that isn't your daily driver 
    - (.NET Core Razor Web App)  
- Do not use AI or CoPilot
